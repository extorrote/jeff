      <h1 class="about-header">The Creative Path to Vallarta</h1>

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Jeff moved to Puerto Vallarta in 2017 from Dallas, where he was co-owner of NUVO, a furniture, design, gift and jewelry store. For over 25 years Jeff oversaw buying and visual merchandising for the store, as well as acting as a design consultant for the store’s clients. He remodeled and furnished multiple residences while living in Dallas.
      </p>

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        After retiring to Vallarta, Jeff was asked by friends to design furniture for their Puerto Vallarta condominium. From that project, others began to ask Jeff for his help with interior design projects and furniture design. Realizing that there is a need for these services in the area, he began his remodeling, interior design and furniture design business in 2024.
      </p>

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Working with craftsmen in Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara, and other areas of Mexico, his furniture designs and designs based on clients’ requests are custom-fabricated at prices well below retail. He has also sourced fabrics and textiles throughout Mexico in order to offer a large selection of unique fabrics to accommodate each client’s needs.
      </p>

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Having begun remodeling projects for friends shortly after moving to Puerto Vallarta, Jeff has been working with many local craftsmen for years. These include carpenters, millworkers, upholsterers and furniture makers who offer the finest quality of work.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “We live in Mexico, and I prefer to offer designs that reflect the amazing beauty and history of Mexican culture. If you’re looking for an interior for your home that will seem like Miami Beach, please choose another designer. I prefer to use local influences, architectural elements, and colors, frequently combining them with elements from other cultures—Morocco, Persia, Brazil—to create a totally unique look, but with its foundation in classic Mexican design."
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        “My own home, though it has a very distinctive Mexican aesthetic with contemporary elements, is very relaxed. For colors I primarily used midnight blue and tan, but with a splash of red as an accent, and shades of terra-cotta in the bedroom areas. Conversely, one client wanted 'very Mexican colors', so I used very bright colors—orange, yellow, turquoise—in each room throughout the home. She was very pleased with the result!”
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        “I’m not afraid of color, and I encourage clients not to be afraid either. However, the use of color can be either vibrant or subtle, depending on the client’s taste.”
      </blockquote>
